# NHANES

Data analysis was performed on NHANES glycohemoglobin data contained in the `nhgh.tsv` file. This includes some basic exploratory data analysis to determine distributions of variables and to determine how the data should be cleaned. SMOTE oversampling was used to balance the dataset before 3 ML models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were used to learn the data and predict if a person has diabetes (gh>=6.5) or not.

Create your own environment and pip install required libraries based on `requirements.txt` before running the notebook.
